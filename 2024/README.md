# Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the
[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges!\
This repository contains my implementations of the daily puzzles using **Bun**,
a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** installed on your system. If not, you
can install it with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
bun --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdellatif-temsamani/adventofcode2024
   cd adventofcode2024
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

### Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, use the following command:

```bash
bun run src/day<N>.ts
```

Replace `<N>` with the day number (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.).

For example, to run the solution for **Day 1**:

```bash
bun run src/day1.ts
```
